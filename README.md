# Customer_segmentation-PCA-
Using PCA and Logistic Regression to find the different categories
1. We have used feature scaling to standardize our values.
2. we have then applied PCA on our dataset to reduce the 10 features into 2 principal components: PC1 and PC2.
3. The PC1 and the PC2 explains the variablilty in the model as would have been explained by the 1 features.
4. We finally segment the customers into 3 different categories.
5. Our model accuracy is high as can be seen in the confusion matrix that has been generated in the last.
